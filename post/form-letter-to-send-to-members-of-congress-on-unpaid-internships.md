# Form Letter to Send to Members of Congress on Unpaid Internships

**Copy the letter below, then fill in the spots for your Representative or Senator's name and your name. If you're not sure who your Representatives and Senators are,** [**click here**](https://www.congress.gov/contact-us) **to visit Congress.gov, enter your address, and it will tell you your Members' names and contact information.

Dear \[Insert Member of Congress’s Name] and staff:

I’m a constituent in your Congressional district. I’m writing to request information about your office’s position on unpaid internships. As I’m sure you know, many political campaigns employ unpaid interns, but this practice cements inequalities in our political system that I feel should be eliminated, not made worse. I urge you to speak out publicly against this practice, and I urge you to pay all interns on your campaign and Congressional staffs.

I have three questions:

1\. Has your Campaign organization, at any time in the last 36 months, run an unpaid internship program?

2\. Has your Congressional office, at any time in the last 36 months, run an unpaid internship program?

3\. What is your official position on unpaid internships? Do you feel they have a rightful place in the American labor market, or should Members of Congress work to eliminate them?

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,&#x20;

\[Your Name]
